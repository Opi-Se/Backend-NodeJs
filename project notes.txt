_____________________ Remaining work ________________________ 

optimization -> 
1- update socket auth by adding middleware instead of the auth function 
2- add validation middleware instead of validation function ( sockets )
3- delete relationship from cache when dismatch
4- save matchId in token
5- validate matchId in validation middleware not in controller ( twice in relationshipCheck and validator )

services ->
1- cron-job to delete all unverified accounts from our system 
2- add blocking service ( array to each user, APIs, do not show blocked people in recommendations )
3- user ranking dashboard 
4- tasks calender 

_____________________ Week sprint ________________________ 

1- tasks module ( socket )
2- edit prefers feature ( get new recommendations when user change his interests ) 


-> final round *__* -> code review and unite testing
